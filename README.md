## Full Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to clone and run the app inside Docker:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rxm-gupta/devops-git-workflow.git
cd devops-git-workflow
```
### 2. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t node-app-image.
```
### 3. Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-app-image
```

### 4. Access the Application

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see:
Hello, this is RAM's Node.js app running in Docker

### Create and switch to a new feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/docker-node-app
```

### Make a Small Change
If you want, edit index.js slightly to simulate a real feature update:

### âœ… Stage, commit, and push changes to GitHub
```bash
git add index.js
git commit -m "Update: improved homepage message"
git push origin feature/docker-node-app
```

### Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub:
#### â†’ Go to GitHub repo
#### â†’ Open a PR from feature/docker-node-app to main
#### â†’ Review and merge it

### Tag the release after merge
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```
